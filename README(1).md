# TensorFlow-Neural-network-on-HAM10000

This is my project to learning image recognition with using of neural network. Whole code is upload in this repo. I split it to two Jupyter Notebooks. 
One is for preprocesing, and the second is for learning. If you want something more, pleas write to me! The dataset i use is HAM10000. Full information and downloadable files you can get from  web page linked bellow.

## Summary

 Learning neural network on different numbers of pictures in each class is bad because your neural network learn to predict only one class. It leads to wrong evaluate metrics. In other way if you create a lot new pictures from "Data generator" you increase learning time. Maybe if you create more epoch you can get more accurate model. But as i see the validation accuracy decreas by second epoch.

 Summary of summary, now:
